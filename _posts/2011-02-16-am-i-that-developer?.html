Recently, I took part in some Twitter based guffawing at a county site that was created using the ArcGIS API for Silverlight.  The site is slow and it has so much unneccessary effects and poor user interaction that using it on a regular basis is going to be mind-numbing for that county's inhabitants.  We in the Twittersphere chortled and snickered at the site, calling it "special" and wondering if anyone at ESRI would come forth and take pride in such a work.  In fact, employees at ESRI got in on the act, making sure that everyone knew that they had nothing to do with the creation of that site.

This Twitter mockery occurred about 10 minutes after I submitted my entry for the <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/devsummit/get-involved/widget-challenge.html" target="_blank">Flex-A-Widget Challenge</a> and tweeted my accomplishment.  My next tweet was my entry into the dogpiling on the county's Silverlight site.  Soon after that, one of my twitterpeers basically called me out.  The tweet said, paraphrasing, "You can't come down on the site, since you just put an entry into the Flex-A-Widget challenge, which propagates sites just like this one."  A bit taken aback, but not wanting to seem so on Twitter, I replied saying I just wanted the t-shirt.  Then, the guilt set in.

As silly as it sounds, I feel a bit of shame for crapping all over that Silverlight site.  Sure, it needs work, and sure, it is far from perfect.  However, someone worked hard on it and thought it was good enough to expose to the public.  My guess is that it's understaffed, overworked, self-trained county resources that, at least temporarily, felt pretty good about releasing something their constituents could use.  And now, here I was, without any clue of who did the site or why it ended up like it did, bullying that site.  And what did my bullying get me? Lumped in with very people that I was mocking.  This has all the makings of an After School Special where I am the bully-turned-good.  How did I get here?

The truth is, I have released massive, Flex-based sites to clients that are behemoth.  Given the choice, I would have gone with an HTML/CSS/javascript site, but I wasn't given the choice.  So, we did the best we could.  In some cases, the clients were dazzled right out of their shoes by a site/web application that would have garnered much of the same snickers from the Twitterati that the Silverlight site.  In other cases, the client was not happy at all, for many of the reasons that plague these huge, RIA sites.  In all cases, I did what I could to sell the client, our internal people, whoever would listen on the reasons to stay with web standards and was rebuffed.  So, I guess I was given a choice: deliver what the client/my boss asked for or quit.

I used to be that developer.  The one that thought anyone not using web standards or ruby or whatever was ignorant and not worth their salt as a developer.  To be honest, I still slip into that role (especially when it comes to Sharepoint...) Over time, however, I have found that position to be distracting.  A narrow, techonology-first focus is hardly ever the right approach.  It's hard not to have that approach.  Really hard.  I want to work in Ruby and Rails.  It's cool and fun and makes me look cool.  When I was told we were doing our first Flex site,I was <a href="http://ruprict.net/2009/01/10/forced-to-flex">not thrilled</a>.  However, I do like ActionScript, and Flex (especially Flex 4) has some really cool stuff.  The community is great, as I find it's made up of people that are into RIA and Open Source (many of them seem to have come from Java).  I'll say it out loud:  I like Flex.

Returning to the shame of mocking that county site, I wonder if the people that made it know its weaknesses.  Is anyone going to give them feedback?  Do they know we all took a Twitter dump on it?  I bet not.  In my opinion, the biggest flaw of the site is it looks like it was never put in front of "real" users before it was released.  I guess the main objective of this site is Parcel Information.  If you just leave the cursor over the map, the site automatically identifies a parcel and some other widget slides in from the right and tells me if I hover over THAT, I can see more data about the parcel I am (inadvertantly) hovering over.  It's a bad user experience, as it seems they tried to minimize mouse clicks or over-fancify the parcle identification process.  I think they'd have been better off just letting the user click on the site, but agains, that's just my opinion.  Furthermore, the RIA frameworks seem to lead people down the path of EVERYTHING having to slide-up/down/right/left or fade-in/out or be draggable over the map.  It leads to a site that, once you've been there more than once or twice, makes you nauseous with effects.  I may be old, but I think a good, old-fashioned toolbar that doesn't block any of the map is a winner.  Oh, and these gigantic compass pan widgets need to go the way of the dodo.

So, what's the point of this post?  When I was first learning web development, I got deep into the web standards movement.  People like Jeffrey Zeldman were (and are, really) legends and I read their books, blogs, tweets, and anything else they spewed forth.  I would spend time viewing the source of a web page so I could see if they used a table-based design, at which point I would feel superior and tell anyone near me (which was usually, to her detriment, my wife) why the site was crap.  My point is, I don't want to be that guy.  I am going to contact that county and ask them if they want another web developer's opinion on their site.  Maybe they'll make it better.

The only thing I've learned for sure as a web developer/programmer is that I am not all that and a bag of chips.  I am not one of the cool kids.   I am just a devloper trying to solve someone's business issue, the best way I know how.
