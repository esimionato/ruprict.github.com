I read a lot of blogs, and many of them have a page dedicated to utilities they use and books they like.  Those blogs are cool, and I want to be like them. So, <a title="Stuff I dig." href="http://ruprict.wordpress.com/tools-and-books" target="_self">here</a> is my page of tools and books (and frameworks).  I plan to add to it as I remember stuff or find new toys.  Feel free to suggest any.
