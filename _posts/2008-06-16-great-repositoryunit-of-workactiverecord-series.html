Ryan Lanciaux has probably one of the best series on setting up the Repository and Unit-of-Work patterns with Rhino Commons, NHibernate, Castle, and Windsor.  He is also using ASP.NET MVC once his repository is all set up.  Check it <a href="http://frickinsweet.com/ryanlanciaux.com/post.aspx?id=d4f4512c-7cea-4857-8006-33f8013f8c1e">out</a>.
