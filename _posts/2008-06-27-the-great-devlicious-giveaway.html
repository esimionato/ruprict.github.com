So, I wrote an entry for <a href="http://devlicio.us/blogs/sergio_pereira/archive/2008/06/05/the-great-devlicio-us-giveaway.aspx" target="_blank">The Great Devlicio.us Giveaway</a>, and I won! <a href="http://devlicio.us/blogs/sergio_pereira/archive/2008/06/27/beginning-continuous-improvement-a-case-study.aspx" target="_blank">My article</a> will be posted on Friday (tomorrow) so check it out.

Thanks to the devlicio.us folks.  I am truly flattered, surprised, and happy to be getting some kickin' prizes.

For what it's worth, I really did make the jump to things ALT<a class="zem_slink" title=".NET Framework" rel="homepage" href="http://www.microsoft.com/net">.NET</a> while working on a new project, which I think made it much easier.  It's hard to pick this stuff up without a real goal in mind.  For example, I've been trying to  become more dangerous with <a class="zem_slink" title="Ruby (programming language)" rel="homepage" href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>, but I just can't make much of it stick b/c I have to make up my own things to write.  I think Ruby is very cool, and it's really the only <a class="zem_slink" title="Dynamic programming language" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language">dynamic language</a> that I've futzed with (someone say "F#"?) but all my "work" work is .NET, <a class="zem_slink" title="HTML" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>, javascript, etc.

I don't really consider myself part of the .NET elite, whoever that is.  I feel like I blue-collared my way onto the bus.  So, if you find yourself trying to make the jump and can't get going, drop me a comment.  I can remember being there.  Actually, I am still there in many ways, which is why I am such a great candidate for continuous improvement.

Yay!
