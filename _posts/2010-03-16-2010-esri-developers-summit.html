So, I'm off to the ESRI Dev Summit next week to meet and learn from a legend (the official unit of measure of geonerds) of geonerds.  I will be giving a user presentation on using Cairngorm 3 to create testable applications with ArcGIS Server.  The presentation is all but done, and I'll have links to the slides as well as the source I use for the demo app once the conference is over.  I am very interested in some of the other user presentations, which span the gamut of what can be done with ArcGIS and a bit of nerd elbow grease.  I'll definitely be attending the Ruby/Rails based user presentations, as well as some of the other Flex and javascript-based presos.  Just like last year, I'll not likely go to any Silverlight presentations, simply because we are not currently using Silverlight.

If you're going to be in Palm Springs this year and want to have a pint or ten, hit me on twitter (@ruprictGeek).  For what I do, the ESRI Developers Summit is far-and-away the most relevant and important conference, so the more geonerds I can meet, the better.

Hope to see you there!
