<a href="http://benl.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Ben Lovel</a>l has started a <a title="Good stuff" href="http://benl.wordpress.com/2008/03/27/incremental-development-with-monorail/" target="_blank">great series</a> on incremental development with MonoRail.  This is exactly what a new (and not so new) Castle or MVC or TDD developer  needs to get going in the right direction.  He even is posting the code on Google.  Great work, Ben!
