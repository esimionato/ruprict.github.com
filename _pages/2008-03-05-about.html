I am a nerd living among NASCAR fans in Charlotte.  I have been working in GIS for about a decade, and with .NET since it's inception.  I have somewhere between 2 and 5 children and a wife that must've lost a bet.  If there is some reason you'd need to contact me, you can hit me <a href="mailto:glenn_goodrich@hotmail.com"> here. </a> I hope you find something useful or amusing or amusingly useful while you are here.
